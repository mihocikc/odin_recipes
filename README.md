# odin_recipes
<h1>Project for The Odin Project</h1>
<h2>What I learned doing this project</h2>
<p>I grew up in the era of hard coding your own MySpace and Tumblr
profiles, so I already knew the absolute basics of html.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my current role deals with html in WordPress, so I
learned to hard code tables and lists, so the html tags and formatting wasn't 
completely new to me. In fact, that was the easiest part.</p>
<p>What I really took away from this project was using VSCode
and Git in the Terminal to manage folders/files and commiting changes to 
the local repository, then pushing to GitHub. Furthermore, I learned 
how the files in folders like /recipes are linkable back to the 
main page.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed learning more about Git and GitHub. There were some
stumbles along the way with creating commit messages (as may be evident in earlier
parts of the log), but the solution was easily findable on Google.</p>
<p>This is just the first step in my journey toward my new career.</p>
<p><i>Bon apetit!</p>

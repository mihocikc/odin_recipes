    <h3>How to make chicken crust pizza</h3>
    Once you have your ingredients <i>mise en place</i> it's time to make the crust.
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450F and place rack on top position and line a 11x14 baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken breast chunks from can and place into a fine strainer, straining as much water out
            as possible. The less liquid in your chicken, the crispier it'll be.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breast chunks in a medium-sized bowl and shred with a fork.</li>
        <li>Mix in salt, pepper, garlic, and parmesean cheese until combined.</li>
        <li>Lightly whisk egg in a separate bowl, then add to chicken crust mixture until combined. (Don't
            be afraid to use your hands!)</li>
        <li>Evenly spread chicken crust mixture on parchment-lined baking sheet, about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Place into oven on top rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until brown and slightly curling around the edges. This may take up to 30 minutes, depending
            on how crispy you want your crust.</li>
        <li>Once done baking, take out of oven and set aside to cool for <strong>at least</strong> 20 minutes. You want the 
            crust to cool completely before topping it with your favorite pizza flavors.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once the crust is completely cool, you can move on to the fun part, which is creating your own chicken crust pizza masterpiece.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Evenly spread your pizza sauce of choice onto the chicken crust.</li>
        <li>Next, add your shredded pizza cheese or mozzarella/provolone blend evenly across the sauced pizza crust.</li>
        <li>Place your favorite pizza toppings around the pizza and throw it back into the 450F oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until cheese is bubbling. For extra crisp, broil the pizza for 5 additional minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove your chicken crust pizza from the oven and allow it to cool for at least 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
